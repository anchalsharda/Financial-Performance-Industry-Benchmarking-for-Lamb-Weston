üîç Project Overview:
Designed a relational database and corresponding E-R diagram to model business operations for a hypothetical organization, defining entities, attributes, and relationships using crow‚Äôs foot notation to support data normalization and efficient storage.
üß† Key Responsibilities & Skills Demonstrated:
Entity-Relationship Modeling:
Defined key business entities such as Customers, Orders, Products, and Employees using table-based structures.
Identified and labeled primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to establish relational integrity.
Modeled relationships between entities (e.g., 1:Many, Many:1) with correct cardinality using crow‚Äôs foot notation.
Schema Design & Normalization:
Applied database normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Used a star or snowflake schema as appropriate for the business context to enhance analytical performance.
Diagram Development & Documentation:
Created a digital E-R diagram using Lucidchart, PowerPoint, or Visio, adhering to industry-standard notation.
Documented entity attributes, relationship directionality, and relational keys to support implementation by technical stakeholders.
‚úÖ Key Outcomes:
Delivered a fully normalized relational database model with clear relationships and schema logic.
Demonstrated proficiency in data modeling, entity design, and technical documentation for database architecture.
Created a foundational structure to support scalable and query-efficient business data operations.
Tools Used:
Advanced Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data analysis, transformation, and visualization.
Power Query: For efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
Pivot Tables: To summarize, explore, and analyze large datasets interactively.
What-If Analysis: Including Data Tables and Scenario Manager to model hypothetical business scenarios.
Conditional Formatting & Dynamic Dashboards: For enhanced visual insights.
VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IFERROR, and Nested Functions: For robust data manipulation and accuracy checks.
